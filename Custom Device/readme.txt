The folder 'IMU' contains all necessary files for the IMU Custom Device. 
In order to implement, copy and paste the folder 'IMU' to the following path:

C:\Users\Public\Documents\National Instruments\NI VeriStand 2015\Custom Devices

Next, open the NI VeriStand System Definition file, right-click on Custom Devices and choose IMU. 
All IMU-data can now be mapped to a Simulink Model or User Interface. 

NOTE: If the cRIO version is different from 2015, the LabVIEW project must be built in the correct version. 
This is explained in the 'readme' file in the 'LabVIEW Project' folder.
